# MongoDB $in Operator with Objects

This repository demonstrates a common error when using the `$in` operator in MongoDB queries with arrays of objects.  The `$in` operator is designed to work with arrays of scalar values (like numbers or strings), not with arrays of objects.  Incorrectly using it can lead to unexpected results.

## Bug
The `bug.js` file contains a query that uses the `$in` operator with an array of objects. This is incorrect and will not return the expected results.

## Solution
The `bugSolution.js` file shows the correct way to use the `$in` operator to query documents containing objects with specific values.  This uses a different approach based on the specific object structure.
